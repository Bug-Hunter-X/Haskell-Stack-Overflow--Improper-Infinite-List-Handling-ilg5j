This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell programming involving the misuse of infinite lists.  The `bug.hs` file contains code that leads to a stack overflow due to an attempt to sum an infinite list. The `bugSolution.hs` file provides a corrected version that utilizes lazy evaluation more effectively.  This example highlights the importance of understanding how Haskell's lazy evaluation works and how to properly handle infinite data structures to avoid performance issues and unexpected crashes.
